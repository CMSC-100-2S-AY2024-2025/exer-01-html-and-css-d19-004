<h2>Steps on how to create GitHub Page:</h2>
<br>
1. Create a folder to the directory of your choice (ex. Desktop).<br>
2. Accept the assignment given to you.<br>
3. Copy the repository link and save it (paste it to a word document, text editor, sticky notes, etc.) as well as your personal token.<br>
4. Paste your token after the 'https://' in the repository link, then add '@' after your token (which now comes before the rest of the repository link). <br>
5. Copy the modified link and open your command prompt.<br>
6. Make sure to open the folder you just made on step 1.<br>
7. Clone the repository by typing 'git clone <modified link>' to the command prompt.<br>
8. Open the folder in VSCode and you can now start editing.<br>
9. Once done, make sure to add, commit, and push your changes to the repository.<br>


- Takeaways: My takeaways for this exercise is basically the whole exercise (aside from the HTML basics like '<html>, <head>') because I forgot how to do those.
